# General Idea

This is an iOS and Android app that is designed to help students with their organisation in school and university. <br>
They have the option to add some habits, goals and track the time they spend with different activities. <br>
The key difference to other habit tracking apps is that it has so many different trackings in one app (habits, goals, pom-timer, tracking) and offers some quotes as well.

# Video Walkthrough

## Habits

The first screen shows off the habits which can be added via the plus symbol. There is also
a help screen under the question mark available. You have different options when adding a habit
like adding an icon, a priority and how often you want to fullfill the habit in how many days. <br>

## Pomodoro Timer

The second screen shows a simple pomodoro timer. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Learn more about it</a><br>
You also have the option to change the intervall and the settings.

## Goals

The third screen shows a goal overview screen. You habe here the option to add a goal you want to fullfill in the future
while having multiple options for the interval like day, week and month.
Like with the habits you also have some configuration options.
A special goal is a time goal which is coupled to the tracking section of the app and pulls the data for the fullfillment
from there.

## Tracking

The fifth tab shows the tracking screen which is designed for tracking the time spent on different activities troughout the day.
You can simply start tracking over the red button and then stop it via the stop button.
It is also possible to edit the trackings afterwards.

## Quotes

To motivate or inspire the students there is also an section for quotes from different people ordered in different categories.
